# DeepDrive
This is Final Year Project of our Bachelors degree.
We are aiming to develop a generic self driving agent that can drive by looking at a picture like the humans do using state-of-the-art Deep Learning & Computer Vision techniques.

Currently We are working on 4 simulators
1. GTA V
2. CARLA
3. Euro Truck Simulator
4. TORCS
